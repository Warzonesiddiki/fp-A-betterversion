# Vault Link Audit

Comprehensive audit of link health: broken wikilinks, orphaned notes, and semantic suggestions.

## Phase 1 — Broken Links

1. Call `obsidian_get_broken_links` (optionally with `subfolder` argument).
2. Present broken links grouped by originating file.
3. For each, suggest: delete the link, create a stub note, or correct the target name.
4. Offer to fix each with `obsidian_replace_in_note` (wrong name → correct name).

## Phase 2 — Orphaned Notes

1. Call `obsidian_list_notes` to enumerate all notes in scope.
2. For each candidate orphan, call `obsidian_get_backlinks`.
3. Notes with zero backlinks and not in `Daily Notes/` are orphan candidates.
4. Present orphan list with options: link from a relevant note, move to archive, or delete.

## Phase 3 — Semantic Suggestions (Optional)

If the user asks for deeper suggestions:

1. For each orphan, call `obsidian_rag_query` with the orphan title as query, `limit: 5`.
2. If strong matches exist, suggest `[[wikilink]]` connections.

## Arguments

Optional subfolder: `/link-audit Engineering/`

## Tips

- For large vaults, always scope to a subfolder first; a full-vault orphan scan is slow
- Broken links in `Daily Notes/` are usually harmless; offer to skip them
- Never make edits without per-change user confirmation
- Run `/obsidian:index` first if `obsidian_get_broken_links` seems incomplete
